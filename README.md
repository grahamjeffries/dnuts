## Maine Donut Map
This project celebrates the legacy of the donut in Maine by displaying renouned donut shops in the state. The map is presented as part of the *Hole History Show: Origins of the American-style Donut*.

The map uses [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) and [Mapbox](www.mapbox.com) tiles, in conjuction with graphics by Alexis Iammarino and Jo Lis to support narrative content written by Kate McCarty. The narrative content was origionally presented in "17 Delectable Doughnut Shops in Maine" by Maine Eater which can be found [here](http://maine.eater.com/maps/best-donuts-maine-doughnuts), and is reproduced here by the author.
